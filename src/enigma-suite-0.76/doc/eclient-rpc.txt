ECLIENT_RPC(1)                                                    ECLIENT_RPC(1)


NAME
        eclient-rpc.py  -  XML-RPC client for a distributed attack on a message


SYNOPSIS  
        eclient-rpc.py [-r] [-p proxyhost:proxyport] http://rpchost:rpcport


DESCRIPTION
        eclient-rpc.py repeatedly connects to an enigma XML-RPC key server
        to try to get a ciphertext and a range of keys. It then launches
        enigma to work on the range. Once the job is done, the results
        are submitted to the server.

        eclient-rpc.py should run forever and at the lowest priority.

        Log output is written to stderr.


OPTIONS
        -p proxyhost:proxyport    Specify HTTP proxy.

        -r                        Append enigma's output to the file
                                  "results" in the run directory.


IMPORTANT NOTE
        eclient-rpc.py has to use the same log-ngram dictionaries as
        the server. ONLY use the official 00trigr.cur and 00bigr.cur
        dictionaries.
