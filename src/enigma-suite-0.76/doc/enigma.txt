DESCRIPTION

        Enigma is a command line simulator for the models Heer, M3 and M4. It
        also has the ability to break Enigma messages using ciphertext-only
        attacks.  The following options fall into five categories:


GENERAL OPTIONS

        -M model        Valid settings are H, M3 or M4. Defaults to H (Heer).
                        This must be the first argument on the command line!
               
        -h              Display help screen.

        -v              Display version information

        -o              Output file. Defaults to stdout.
          

SIMULATOR OPTIONS

        -u ukw            Umkehrwalze: Select A (Heer only), B or C.
                          Defaults to B.

        -w wheel-order    Valid settings are 123 thru G876. Left letter [B,G]
                          stands for wheels Beta or Gamma (M4 only). Left digit
                          stands for left wheel, middle digit stands for middle
                          wheel, right digit stands for right wheel. Digits must
                          not be repeated. Defaults to 123.

        -r ring-settings  Valid settings are AAA thru ZZZZ. Defaults to AAA.

        -s stecker-pairs  Valid settings are 1 to 13 pairs of letters. No spaces
                          in between. Letters must not be repeated. Defaults to
                          none.

        -m message-key    Valid settings are AAA thru ZZZZ. Defaults to AAA.


IC OPTIONS

        -i [COMMON OPTIONS] <trigram-dict> <bigram-dict> <ciphertext>

             Break an enigma message using ic statistics. This option
             requires three command line arguments, the log-ngram dictionaries
             <trigram-dict>, <bigram-dict> and the message <ciphertext>.
             If no range is specified with the -f and/or -t options, the
             program runs in two stages:
               
             First it iterates through all UKW, wheel and message settings. All
             letters are left unsteckered, and the rings remain set to A. The
             setting yielding the highest ic count in the decrypted candidate
             plaintext is retained. Then all fast ring settings are tried, the
             best one is retained, same for the  middle rings. Subsequently a
             hill climb is used to determine the stecker settings.

             In the second stage the  procedure is repeated, this time iterating
             through all UKW, wheel, message AND ring settings.

             If a range is specified, the program immediately starts at the
             second stage.

             The ic approach does not work well on shorter messages.
       

HILL CLIMB OPTIONS

        -c  [COMMON AND HILL CLIMB OPTIONS] <trigram-dict> <bigram-dict>
            <ciphertext>
          
             Break an enigma message using hill climbing. This option requires
             three command line arguments, the log-ngram dictionaries
             <trigram-dict>, <bigram-dict> and the message <ciphertext>.
             If no range is specified, the program iterates through all UKW,
             wheel, fast ring and message settings, attempting a hill climb
             on each of the settings.

        -n n Number of passes. Defaults to 1.

        -z n Terminate if score n is reached. Useful for testing.
             Defaults to INT_MAX-1.

        -k keystring
             Perform hill climb on a single arrangement specified by
             <keystring>. Useful for testing.

        -R   Standalone option:  Resume a hill climb:  When the program receives
             SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGQUIT, the state of the hill climb is saved to
             the file ``00hc.resume''. With this option the hill climb can be
             started again from where it left off. Only the -o option can be
             given in combination with -R.


SEARCH SPACE OPTIONS

        Default:
             Only settings where the slow wheel moves before the first
             letter is enciphered are tested within the given range.

        -x   All other settings which result in a slow wheel movement are
             tested. This option complements the default run.

        -a   All settings where the slow wheel moves are tested.


COMMON OPTIONS

        -f keystring  Search from (including) <keystring>.
          
        -t keystring  Search up to (including) <keystring>.
                      This keystring has to be greater
                      or equal to the -f keystring.


KEYSTRING

        The keystrings used to specify ranges with -f and -t have the
        following format:


                Lowest:                        Highest:
                   
          H :   A:123:AA:AAA                   C:543:ZZ:ZZZ
          M3:   B:123:AA:AAA                   C:876:MM:ZZZ
                |  |  ||  |
                |  |  ||  `left, middle, right message key
                |  |  ``- middle, right ring
                |  `left, middle, right wheel
                `ukw


          M4:   B:B123:AA:AAAA                 C:G876:MM:ZZZZ
                | | |  ||  ||
                | | |  ||  ``greek, left, middle, right message key
                | | |  ``-middle, right ring
                | | `left, middle, right wheel
                | `greek wheel
                `ukw

        If the -f option is omitted, the lowest possible keystring is assumed.
        If the -t option is omitted, the highest possible keystring is assumed.

        The program increments the keystring in the way of an odometer,
        starting at the right message key. Settings resulting in an illegal
        wheel order are skipped.


        M3, M4 specialty:

        When the middle or right wheel is one of [6-8], only 13 ring settings
        have to be checked, so rings [N-Z] are skipped. In these cases the
        program only allows rings [A-M] as the bounds.

        With the -k option all rings are allowed.


RESUME FILE

        The resume file ``00hc.resume'' captures the state of the hill climb at
        interrupt time and stores the information in this order:

        Line 1:

            model, keystring-from, keystring to, keystring-current,
            slow-wheel-mode, n-passes, firstpass, max_score

        Line 2 (best key found so far):

            model, keystring-best-key, stecker-best-key, score-best-key

        In the actual file the items are separated by '='.

        slow-wheel-mode can have the values 0 (default), 1 (-x option),
        2 (-a option).

        firstpass can have the values 1 (yes) or 0 (no).

        n-passes and max_score can have the values 0-(INT_MAX-1).



SIMULATION EXAMPLES

        To en/decipher a text using the default settings, simply enter:
          
             enigma
          
        Type in the text (white-space allowed), then enter EOF (CTRL-D
        on unix systems) to start en/decryption. If you have not entered
        a newline after the last letter, you have to enter EOF twice.


        Some examples using various models and various settings:

             enigma -M H -u B -w 531 -r QIX -s MNBVCXZLKJHGFDSAPOIU -m ACE
             enigma -M M3 -u C -w 781 -r GHL -s QWERTYUIOPAS -m WSK
             enigma -M M4 -u B -w G273 -r RGSK -s LKJHGFDSAPOIUYTREWQM -m QKLC

             
MESSAGE BREAKING EXAMPLES

        Attempt to break a message using ic statistics, both stages (see
        -i option):

             enigma -M H -i trigram_dict bigram_dict ciphertext


        Attempt to break a message using ic statistics, only check within
        the given range:

             enigma -M H -i -f "A:231:AA:BBB" -t "A:231:AA:ZZZ" trigram_dict
             bigram_dict ciphertext


        Attempt to break a message using hill climbing, only check scrambler
        states that have an equivalent where the slow wheel does not move:

             enigma -M M3 -c -f "B:456:AA:FFF" -t "C:183:AA:BCF" trigram_dict
             bigram_dict ciphertext


        Check scrambler states that can only be expressed in terms of the
        slow wheel moving:

             enigma -M M3 -cx -f "B:456:BA:FFF" -t "C:183:BA:BCF" trigram_dict
             bigram_dict ciphertext


        Attempt to break an M4 message, check all unique scrambler states,
        300 passes, output to resultfile:

             enigma -M M4 -ca -n 300 -o resultfile trigram_dict bigram_dict
             ciphertext


        Test a single arrangement, 100 passes, abort if score is higher than
        3500000:

             enigma -c -n 100 -z 3500000 -k "B:123:SK:JKL" trigram_dict
             bigram_dict ciphertext


RETURN VALUE

        enigma returns 0 on success, EXIT_FAILURE on failure, 111 if it
        has stopped on SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGQUIT during a hill climb.
