Version 1.8.11:
Reorganised setup64() so that Legendre symbols are computed earlier. This
 allows an earlier short-circuit in the case that no sequences pass the
 quadratic residue test. Faster when there are few sequences in the sieve,
 but a little slower when there are many.

Version 1.8.10: (Posted 17 September 2009)
Fixed an array overrun that occurred when the subsequence base b^Q had Q<16.
 This bug was introduced in version 1.8.6. Thanks to Lélio Ribeiro de Paula
 for reporting it.
Use .text instead of .rodata section in lookup-x86_64.S, for portability.
Added Urias McCullough's changes for Haiku (config.h, priority.c).

Version 1.8.9: (Posted 16 March 2009)
Fixed an array overrun bug that could cause a segfault when memory is freed
 at the end of a sieve range. Affected x86/x86_64 builds 1.8.7-1.8.8.
Added --log-factors switch which causes new factors to be recorded in the
 log file (with a datestamp).

Version 1.8.8: (Posted 31 January 2009)
Changed the heuristic for choosing the subsequence base exponent Q to take
 into account whether the power residue tests are done or not (-X switch).

Version 1.8.7: (Posted 27 January 2009)
Added x86/x86_64 ASM to calculate the indices into the Legendre symbol
 lookup tables using precomputed inverses. New files lookup-*.S
Changed the power residue test to use inverse base when sieving dual form
 sequences, instead of computing inverse k.

Version 1.8.6: (Posted 16 January 2009)
Reduced BASE_MULTIPLE from 30 to 2.
Put SUBSEQ.d field into a separate array subseq_d[] to improve cachability.
Put SEQ.sc_lists field into a separate array SCL[] to avoid allocating
 memory that is not needed when -X switch is being used.
Moved code for setting up steps[] array from bsgs.c into choose.c so that it
 doesn't have to be included in each separate code path.
Adjusted coefficients to favour selecting a higher subsequence base exponent.

Version 1.8.5: (Posted 13 January 2009)
Don't double-check duplicate factors unless --duplicates switch is used.
 This reduces child/parent thread communication needs a bit.

Version 1.8.4: (Posted 12 January 2009)
Added a new switch `-x --no-lookup' to compute Legendre symbols as needed
 instead of precomputing lookup tables. Slower but saves memory and init time.
Added new switches `--scale-giant X' and `--min-giant NUM' for manually
 tuning the baby-step/giant-step ratios.

Version 1.8.3: (Posted 7 November 2008)
Added new command line switch `--ladder METHOD' to select METHOD for ladder
 mulmods. METHOD can be one of: add/1, gen/2, gen/4, gen/6, gen/8 (and for
 the 32-bit executable: sse2/2, sse2/4, sse2/8, sse2/16).
The `-d --dual' switch is now optional when reading the sieve from an ABCD
 format file. If not given then dual/standard mode will be set according to
 the form of the first sequence in the file.

Version 1.8.2: (Posted 24 September 2008)
Fixed a bug in the reading of the sr2sieve-command-line.txt file that could
 cause DOS format files to be rejected by UNIX executables.
In events.c, set the next save/report time in check_process() relative to
 current time rather than the last save/report time. This works better when
 the program is paused for long periods of time.
Create all archives with ZIP. Put all executables into one archive.

Version 1.8.1: (Posted 3 September 2008)
New process priority behaviour is incompatiple with previous versions:
 Default is not to change process priority (previous default was idle).
 -zz sets lowest priority (nice 20)
 -z  sets low priority (nice 10)
 -Z  sets high priority (nice -10)
 -ZZ sets highest priority (nice -20)

Version 1.8.0: (Posted 1 September 2008)
For terms k*b^n+c, instead of solving b^n = -c/k (mod p), solve the
 equivalent equation 1/b^n = -k/c (mod p). This avoids the need to compute
 1/k (mod p) for each sequence. For the dual terms b^n+/-k, solve the
 equation b^n = -k/c (mod p) as before. This change means that there can no
 longer be k*b^n+/-1 and dual b^n+/-k terms together in the sieve.
Removed PRE_POWER option in bsgs.c which is incompatible with above changes.
Added a new `-d --dual' switch to enable sieving the b^n+/-k form. .dat
 format files will now be assumed to contain b^n+/-k if this is used. ABCD
 files which contain terms of the wrong form will be rejected.

Version 1.7.15: (Posted 1 September 2008)
Fixed a bug in sr5sieve.c that incorrectly allowed sieving with p < k.
Set DUAL=0 and SKIP_CUBIC_OPT=0 when compiling the sr5sieve executables.

Version 1.7.14: (Posted 15 August 2008, source only)
Replaced i386 and x86_64 inline cpuid() and timestamp() functions with
 external functions in misc-i386.S and misc-x86-64.S to avoid problems with
 clobbering the PIC register in OS X.
Updated LDFLAGS for x86-osx and x86-64-osx builds.
Thanks to Michael Tughan for the x86-osx and x86-64-osx build options.

Version 1.7.13: (Posted 12 August 2008, source only)
In priority.c, use PRIO_MAX=10 if not defined in sys/resource.h
In mulmod-i386.S, added a non-inline mulmod64_i386() function for use with
 compilers that have difficulty with the inline version. Remove
 -DUSE_INLINE_MULMOD from CPPFLAGS to use the new function.
Added Makefile options ARCH=x86-osx and ARCH=x86-64-osx to simplify building
 on Intel Macs. Made USE_INLINE_MULMOD=0 the default for ARCH=x86-osx.

Version 1.7.12: (Posted 25 July 2008)
Added `-X --skip-cubic' switch.

Version 1.7.11: (Posted 10 June 2008)
Fixed a buffer overflow that could occur when printing messages with long
 file names. Thanks Chuck Lasher for reporting this bug.

Version 1.7.10: (Posted 6 April 2008)
Fixed calculation of accumulated elapsed time, as reported in the checkpoint
 file and at the end of a range, which could overflow in versions 1.7.0-1.7.9.

Version 1.7.9: (Posted 1 March 2008)
Set HAVE_SETAFFINITY=0 for OS X.
Check the return status of localtime() and strftime() before calling
 printf() with the results. This prevents a Windows access violation when
 the ETA date is invalid. Thanks Chuck Lasher for reporting this bug and
 helping to track down the cause.

Version 1.7.8: (Posted 23 February 2008)
Write cpu_secs field in checkpoint using cpu time as in versions 1.6.x. It
 will not be accurate when the -t switch is used.
Added elapsed_secs field to checkpoint file containing accumulated elapsed
 time in seconds.

Version 1.7.7:
Use `addc' instead of `adde' instruction in ppc64 mulmod.

Version 1.7.6: (Posted 20 January 2008)
Added a generic vec_powmod64() function
Set USE_MOVDQU=0 in powmod-sse2.S.

Version 1.7.5: (Posted 19 January 2008)
Re-ordered the power-residue code in setup64() to allow use of a vectorised
 powmod function: vec_powmod64(B[],len,n,p) computes B[i]^n (mod p) for each
 0 <= i < len. This should allow the powmod operations to be fully pipelined.
Implemented vec_powmod64() for x86 and x86-64 using a left-right algorithm.
Don't allow pmin < POWER_RESIDUE_LCM so that vec_powmod64() needn't check
 for a zero exponent.

Version 1.7.4: (Posted 15 January 2008)
Improved powmod implementation for x86-64 and x86/sse2: For each bit in the
 exponent the old implementation used 1 sqrmod + 1/2 mulmod + 1 unpredictable
 branch; The new implementation uses 1 sqrmod + 1 mulmod + 1 conditional move.

Version 1.7.3: (Posted 12 January 2008)
Extended the maximum number of subsequences from 2^16-1 to 2^32-1. This
 avoids a bug in the congruence table code, introduced in version 1.4.22,
 where the 2^16-1 limit was not always being enforced.
Reduced BASE_MULTIPLE from 60 to 30.

Version 1.7.2:
Moved child/parent branch into eliminate_term().
Removed reference to mod64_rnd in factors.c for non-x86 builds.

Version 1.7.1: (Posted 4 January 2008)
Fixed a bug that caused the final packet of results from the last exiting
 child thread to be lost.

Version 1.7.0: (Posted 3 January 2008)
Added simple multithreading using fork() and pipe(). The new switch
 `-t --threads N' will start N child threads. See README-threads.
When multithreading, let each use of the `-A --affinity N' switch set
 affinity for successive child threads.
Use elapsed time for all statistics. Removed `-e --elapsed-time' switch.

Version 1.6.17: (Posted 27 December 2007)
Added version number to name used in log entries. Thanks `Cruelty' for this
 suggestion.
Added new `-q --quiet' switch to prevent found factors being printed.

Version 1.6.16: (Posted 11 December 2007)
Just set thread affinity, not process affinity, for Windows.
Added a new makefile target ARCH=x86-64-gcc430 with compiler optimisation
 reduced to -O1 for use when compiling with GCC 4.3.0. This version of GCC
 generates incorrect code at -O2 and higher causing a segfault in the
 windows-x86-64 executable soon after starting when the x87 FPU code path is
 used (when sieving p > 2^51 or when the --no-sse2 switch is given). Thanks
 Bryan O'Shea for finding this bug and Adam Sutton for helping to find a
 workaround.

Version 1.6.15: (Posted 7 December 2007)
Undo the change made in 1.6.14 to allocate extra elements for BJ64[]. The
 baby-steps overrun can never exceed the minimum size of the array.
Added `-A --affinity N' switch to set affinity to CPU N.

Version 1.6.14: (Posted 3 December 2007)
Sign-extend the count argument to the x86-64 gen/6 mulmod method. This bug
 could cause a segfault during baby-steps when there is only one (or perhaps
 a very small number) of terms in a sequence. Thanks AES for the bug report.
Allocate an extra 8 elements for BJ64[] to allow extra baby steps overrun.

Version 1.6.13: (Posted 8 November 2007)
Allow maximum hashtable density to exceed 1.0 if necessary.
When p == k*b^n+c just log k*b^n+c as a prime term, don't eliminate k*b^n+c
 from the sieve or report p as a factor.

Version 1.6.12: (Posted 3 November 2007)
Ranges in SoBStatus.dat and nextrange.txt are now written with the pmax=
 line before the pmin= line. Ranges can be read in either order.
If the -r switch is used without the -s switch then `RieselStatus.dat' is
 used instead of `SoBStatus.dat', as stated in the README.

Version 1.6.11: (Posted 23 October 2007)
Fixed p -> b typo in mulmod-ppc64.c
Save %xmm1-4 across function call in giant-x86-64.S.
In sobistrator mode initialize the starting time/prime in read_checkpoint().
 This fixes the strange kp/s figure reported in the first checkpoint after
 continuing from an existing range in SoBStatus.dat.

Version 1.6.10: (Posted 20 October 2007)
New switch `-j --sobistrator' to run in Sobistrator compatibility mode.
 Checkpoints are written to SoBStatus.dat, ranges read from nextrange.txt.
 Factors written to fact.txt and duplicates to factexcl.txt by default.

Version 1.6.9: (Posted 14 October 2007)
New giant step method for x86-64, performs mulmods and hashtable lookups in
 the same pass. (Method name new/4).
Use .globl instead of .global to declare global assembler symbols, for
 compatibility with the Apple assembler.

Version 1.6.8:
Use search_hashtable() for the first giant step too.

Version 1.6.7: (Posted 8 October 2007)
New i386 and x86-64 assembly for main hashtable routines: build_hashtable(),
 search_hashtable().

Version 1.6.6: (Posted 5 October 2007)
Set CONST_EMPTY_SLOT=0 for all 64-bit machines, even those with 32-bit
 longs. This probably accounted for most of the performance problems with
 the x86-64 Windows build.
Added a kludge to ensure that x86-64 Windows clears the hashtable using
 64 bit operations.
Prevent the gen/6 method being automatically selected unless running on AMD.
 The user can still select it manually with the -B or -G switches. For some
 reason on Core 2 the SSE2 gen/6 method is fast for benchmarking, but slow
 for actual sieving.

Version 1.6.5: (Posted 4 October 2007)
Fixed missing timestamp() declaration when built with USE_ASM=0.
Added seperate vec_mulmod64_initp() calls to allow building with just the
 basic mulmod functions coded in assembler while allowing the  generic
 vector mulmod functions to call the assembler mulmods.
Managed different x86-64 calling conventions by using symbolic register
 names instead of adding a prelude to convert from _WIN64 conventions.

Version 1.6.4: (Posted 2 October 2007)
Added REPORT_CPU_USAGE option to alternately report percentage of CPU time
 used and percentage of range done on the status line.
Added ELAPSED_TIME_OPT to enable the `-e --elapsed-time' switch which
 reports the p/sec and sec/factor stats in elapsed instead of CPU time.
Combined x86-intel and x86-amd targets into one x86 target. Use --amd or
 --intel switches to override the automatic code path selection.
Replaced x86-64 and ppc64 inline vector mulmod assembly with external
 functions (in mulmod-x86-64.S, mulmod-x87-64.S, mulmod-ppc64.c).
Added gen/6 mulmod methods for x86-64. Might be faster on Athlon 64.
Added `-f --factors FILE' to override the factors file name with FILE.
Added duplicate factors file: `-D --duplicates FILE' switch now appends
 duplicate factors to FILE instead of just reporting them to screen.
Added `-S --save TIME' switch to write checkpoint every TIME seconds.

Version 1.6.3: (Posted 28 September 2007, source and Linux binaries only)
Don't install handlers for signals whose initial handler is SIG_IGN.

Version 1.6.2: (Posted 27 September 2007, source/windows-x86-64 binary only)
Changes to allow building with MinGW64:
 * Define NEED_UNDERSCORE in config.h
 * Don't use __mingw_aligned_malloc in util.h
 * Allow for sizeof(uint_fast32_t)==4 in asm-x86-64-gcc.h

Version 1.6.1: (Posted 25 September 2007)
Allow seqences k*b^n+/-1 and b^n+/-k to be sieved together.
Added some information about creating ABCD files in README2.

Version 1.6.0: (Posted 24 September 2007, source and dual-* binaries only)
Made modifications suggested by Phil Moore to allow sieving b^n+/-k
 instead of k*b^n+/-1. Set DUAL=1 in sr5sieve.h to enable.
Made dual-sr2sieve binaries compiled with BASE=0 and DUAL=1 for testing.

Version 1.5.19: (Posted 24 September 2007)
Use stack shadow space instead of red zone on _WIN64.
Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.4.27 that caused an error message at
 startup if the -P switch was used without the -p switch when the sieve
 file contained the start of the sieve range.
Avoid use of variable length automatic arrays when compiling with MSC.

Version 1.5.18: (Posted 9 September 2007)
Schedule loads a little earlier in x86-64 mulmods. About 1% faster on C2D.
Handle SIGHUP by writing a checkpoint before calling the default handler.
Use clock() for benchmarking if gettimeofday() is not available.
Added SET_FPU_PRECISION=1 to force the FPU into double extended precision
 mode. This shouldn't be necessary, but it costs nothing to be safe.

Version 1.5.17: (Posted 3 August 2007)
Fixed a bug in the xmemalign() and xfreealign() functions used by systems
 without a native memalign() function. The usual result was an invalid
 pointer being passed to free() at the end of a sieving range. If the work
 file was being used and contained multiple sieve ranges, a major memory
 leak could result. Many thanks to Mark Rodenkirch for finding this bug.
 Affected Windows versions 1.4.42 - 1.5.15, OS X versions 1.4.42 - 1.5.16.

Version 1.5.16: (Posted 1 August 2007)
Use __mingw_aligned_malloc() to allocate aligned memory with mingw32.
Testing reveals that the x86-64 SSE2 mulmod can fail with modulus between
 2^51 and 2^52. Reduced SSE2/FPU crossover to 2^51 to be safe. (Failures
 were rare below 4*10^15).

Version 1.5.15: (Posted 13 July 2007)
New vector mulmod code for x86 machines without SSE2. (mulmod-i386.S).

Version 1.5.14: (Posted 10 July 2007)
Increase baby steps as far as the next multiple of vector length if
 doing so will reduce the number of giant steps.
Modified assembler for sse2/8 and sse2/16 methods to reduce the maximum
 overrun to 4 elements. This is especially beneficial when the number of
 giant steps is large.
Fixed a bug in sr2test.c introduced in 1.5.11 that would cause `make check'
 to incorrectly report errors when built without SSE2 enabled.

Version 1.5.13: (Posted 6 July 2007)
Removed unnecessary "cld" instruction in x86/x86-64 memset_fast32().
Improved generic memset_fast32(): store 8 uint_fast32_t per loop iteration.
Set b=X[1] to prevent X[1] aliasing X[i] in climb_ladder_<N>() functions.
Fixed x86_64_select_code_path() bug introduced in version 1.5.12 that would
 probably have prevented the SSE2 code path ever being selected. Thanks
 `Cruelty' for reporting this bug.
Report the BSGS range when given the -vv switch.
A small improvement to baby steps methods sse2/8 and sse2/16.

Version 1.5.12: (Posted 2 July 2007)
Added a MULTI_PATH option for x86-64. If range end is between 2^52 and 2^62
 switch code paths from SSE2 to FPU automatically.
Added Makefile target x86-64 for building with the MULTI_PATH option.
Added VEC8 macros for ppc64.

Version 1.5.11:
Fixed a typo (trailing comma) in asm-ppc64.h.
Removed redundant uses of register r26 in expmod-ppc64.S.
Use the new ppc64 PRE2, VEC2, VEC4 macros by default. Ed's testing shows
 they are faster than the old ones.
Changed type of global variables in asm-ppc64.c to unsigned long long int in
 an attempt to get GCC to recognise them as invariant during critical loops.
Removed USE_INT_MULMOD option for x86-64. It was significantly slower than
 the USE_FPU_MULMOD code, according to Core2 benchmarks by `Cruelty'.
Made powmod-k8.S and powmod-k8-fpu.S usable by WIN64, and a few other
 changes to allow for compilation by mingw64 when it arrives.
Updated srtest.c for SSE2 changes since version 1.5.6.

Version 1.5.10: (Posted 28 June 2007, source and x86-64 binaries only)
Modified ppc64 VEC2 and VEC4 macros to use fixed condition register names.
 In asm-ppc64.h set EXPERIMENTAL=1 to use a single condition register, or
 EXPERIMENTAL=2 to use multiple condition registers.
Added USE_INT_MULMOD option for x86-64 to use ppc64 style mulmods.
Added k8-int target, compiled with USE_FPU_INT, to Makefile.

Version 1.5.9: (Posted 26 June 2007, source only)
Set HAVE_MEMALIGN=0 for OS X in config.h. Don't include <malloc.h> unless
 needed.
New assembler for ppc64 PRE2, VEC2 and VEC4 macros. Set EXPERIMENTAL=1 in
 asm-ppc64.h to enable.

Version 1.5.8: (Posted 24 June 2007, source and x86-64 binary only)
Added VEC8_* macros for x86-64. (Enables gen/8 methods).
Fixed FPU stack corruption in powmod_k8_fpu() that would have caused all
 sorts of trouble for sr2sieve-fpu. Thanks `Cruelty' for the bug report.

Version 1.5.7: (Posted 22 June 2007)
Added FPU versions of VEC<N>_* macros for x86-64 when USE_FPU_MULMOD=1.
Added sr2sieve-fpu binary compiled with USE_FPU_MULMOD=1 to the x86-64
 distribution.
Added VEC_* macros for ppc64, defined in terms of PRE2_MULMOD64() macro.
 Thanks Ed (sheep) for testing.
Added assembler timestamp() for ppc64. Thanks Mark Rodenkirch for the code.
Increased the Sieve of Eratosthenes bitmap limit to 2048Kb from 512Kb in
 version 1.5.6. The user can set a lower limit by use of the -L switch.

Version 1.5.6: (Posted 18 June 2007)
Improved powmod for x86-64: Use predictable branch instead of CMOV, align
 main loop on a 16 byte boundary, short-circuit for n=0 or n=1 cases.
Improved x86/SSE2 code (mulmod-sse2.S, powmod-sse2.S): Replaced movdqa with
 movq/movhps after fistpll and movlps/movhps before fildll in powmod64(),
 sse2/2 and sse2/4 methods. Interleave four instead of two multiplies in
 sse2/4, sse2/8 and sse2/16 methods.
Small improvement to the linear search routine in setup64().
Added -mtune=k8 to PATH2_FLAGS for x86-amd build.
Call cpuid to serialize before calling rdtsc in x86/x86-64 timestamp().
Limit Sieve of Eratosthenes bitmap to lesser of 512Kb or half L2 cache.

Version 1.5.5: (Posted 26 May 2007)
Improved the x86-64 mulmod based on benchmark for Core2: Use branch instead
 of conditional move, and schedule floating point instructions earlier.
If USE_ASM=0 use gettimeofday() instead of rdtsc on x86/x86-64.
Align BD64[1] on a 64-byte instead of 16-byte boundary.
Fixed unnecessary overrun in climb_ladder_1.

Version 1.5.4: (Posted 23 May 2007, source and x86-64 binaries only)
Fixed the x86-64 version of the VEC4_MULMOD64 macro. x86-64 builds for
 versions 1.5.1-1.5.3 would have returned incorrect results when the gen/4
 method was used for giant steps.

Version 1.5.3: (Posted 18 May 2007)
The end-of-array marker used in the vector versions of baby_steps() was
 overwritten by the hashtable empty-slot marker. This could cause a segfault
 if both the vector mulmod code and the non-constant empty-slot hashtable
 code were used together. Only affected x86-64 builds for versions
 1.5.1-1.5.2.  Thanks `Cruelty' for finding this bug.
Run benchmarks twice and take the times from the second run. The first run
 makes sure everything is in the cache.

Version 1.5.2: (Posted 14 May 2007)
Zero arrays allocated for use with VEC*_MULMOD64 macros. This ensures that
 the overrun area does not contain any junk that could trigger exceptions.
Fixed a potential segfault in the benchmark code. Baby steps must be called
 to initialise the hashtable before benchmarking the giant steps routine, in
 case the baby steps benchmark was skipped by use of the -B switch.
Update Intel cache size detection code to use extended cpuid function 6 if
 L2 cache size was not found otherwise.

Version 1.5.1: (Posted 13 May 2007, source and x86-64 binaries only)
Added VEC2_* and VEC4_* macros for x86-64.

Version 1.5.0: (Posted 12 May 2007, source and x86 binaries only)
Choose which mulmod macros to use based on benchmarks taken before sieving
 starts. (x86 only so far).
Add -Wa,-W to CPPFLAGS to turn off assembler warnings for x86 builds. They
 are caused by an inline assembler expression such as 4+%1 expanding to
 4+(%esi) instead of 4+0(%esi), harmless but AFAIK unavoidable.

Version 1.4.42: (Posted 8 May 2007)
Align memory for vector ops on 64- or 128- instead of 16-byte boundarys.
Added VEC_* macros for non-SSE2 x86 machines.

Version 1.4.41: (Posted 8 May 2007)
Fixed *_clock() functions to return CPU times in Windows. Previous versions
 used clock() when getrusage() was not available, but clock() returns
 elapsed time instead of CPU time in Windows. (clock.c).

Version 1.4.40: (Posted 6 May 2007)
Use VEC8_* and VEC16_* macros instead of VEC4_* macros in SSE2 code path.

Version 1.4.39: (Posted 17 April 2007)
Fixed a bad CPUID parameter in the non-intel cache detection code (cpu.c).

Version 1.4.38: (Posted 16 April 2007)
Use VEC4_* macros instead of vec4_* inline functions.

Version 1.4.37: (Posted 7 April 2007)
New vec4_* functions to fill arrays 4 elements at a time in SSE2 code path.

Version 1.4.36: (Posted 24 March 2007, source only)
Added missing definition of CPU_DIR_NAME for ppc64/Linux in cpu.c
Set BASE=0 to allow the base b in k*b^n+c to be determined at runtime. Set
 BASE=b to fix base b at compile time, as in previous versions. With BASE=0
 the filenames will be as for BASE=2: sr2work.txt etc.

Version 1.4.35: (Posted 20 March 2007, source only)
Fixed some problems with the source archive and Makefile: factors.o was
 included in source instead of factors.c; end-of-line comments in the
 Makefile were not being stripped. Thanks Ed for finding these bugs.

Version 1.4.34: (Posted 18 March 2007)
Fixed the cpuid cache size detection code on AMD machines. Thanks
 `Flatlander' for reporting this bug.

Version 1.4.33: (Posted 17 March 2007)
Replaced some 64-bit variables with 32-bit ones in the Sieve of Eratosthenes
 main sieving loop. Performance on 32-bit machines is a little better,
 hopefully not at a cost to 64-bit machines.
ppc64/Linux cache detection now checks directories in /proc/device-tree/cpus
 for cache size files and sets the cache size from the first one found.

Version 1.4.32: (Posted 15 March 2007)
Detect L1/L2 data cache size by reading /proc on ppc64/Linux. Thanks Ed for
 the code.
Added SSE2 detection and a seperate SSE2 code path selectable at runtime.
 `--sse2' or `--no-sse2' can be used to override automatic detection.
Added Makefile targets x86-intel/x86-amd to create binaries that will run on
 any Pentium compatible, but with base code path tuned for Pentium2/Athlon
 and SSE2 code path tunes for Pentium4/Athlon64.

Version 1.4.31: (Posted 11 March 2007, source only)
Checkpoint whenever SIGUSR1 is raised (if SIGUSR1 is defined in signal.h).
New command line switch `-C -cache-file FILE' loads the cache from FILE if
 it exists, or writes a new cache to FILE if it doesn't.
Existing command line switch `-c --cache' now continues sieving after
 writing the new cache file `sr5cache.bin'.
Checkpoint file now also records accumulated cpu time for the range, and the
 fraction of the range that has been done (for use by BOINC wrapper).
Detect L1/L2 data cache size using sysctl on ppc64/MacOS X. Thanks Alex for
 the code.

Version 1.4.30: (Posted 9 March 2007)
Detect L1/L2 data cache size using cpuid instruction on x86/x86_64.
Set UPDATE_BITMAPS=1 to remove terms as factors are found, UPDATE_BITMAPS=0
 for compatibility with proth_sieve.

Version 1.4.29: (Posted 7 March 2007)
If no command line arguments are given, read them from a file called
 `sr5sieve-command-line.txt' if one exists in the current directory.
Report and log the number of found factors even if the range is not complete
 when the program is stopped.
Once a factor has been found, alternate status line between reporting ETA
 and factor rate.
Truncate the status line to 80 characters.

Version 1.4.28: (Posted 24 February 2007)
Added switches `-z --idle' to start at idle priority, the default, and
 `-Z --no-idle' to not alter the priority level. Set IDLE_DEFAULT=0 in
 sr5sieve.h to make -Z the default.

Version 1.4.27: (Posted 22 February 2007)
The -k8 build was broken in version 1.4.21 due to faulty L1_CACHE_SIZE and
 L2_CACHE_SIZE Makefile parameters. Fixed.
Added `-i --input FILE' command line switch to read the sieve from FILE
 instead of sr5data.txt.
Added `-p --pmin P0' and `-P --pmax P1' command line switches to sieve for
 factors p in P0 <= p <= P1 instead of reading ranges from sr5work.txt.
Added `-u --uid STRING' command line switch to append -STRING to the base of
 per-process file names (checkpoint.txt,factors.txt,sr5work.txt,sr5sieve.log).
 This allows multiple sr5sieve processes to run in the same directory.
Include the `-d --delete' `-g --newpgen' `-a --abc' command line switches
 only when compiled with BASE=5. These are used for the SR5 project.
Moved some initialization from init_bsgs(), which is done before each new
 range, to init_sieve() which is only done once.

Version 1.4.26: (Posted 21 February 2007)
Replaced the huge switch in setup64() with an if-elif-else construct using a
 runtime-computed table. This may be slightly slower on some machines, but
 avoids the need for manually constructing the switch, which was tedious and
 susceptible to human error. It should now be possible to set a different
 value for POWER_RESIDUE_LCM without any other changes to the source.

Version 1.4.25: (Posted 19 February 2007)
Added USE_SETUP_HASHTABLE option to use a small hashtable lookup instead of
 a linear search to find the power residue partial products in setup64().
Extended power residue tests to 16-th powers.

Version 1.4.24: (Posted 18 February 2007)
Relaxed the unnecessarily conservative limit on the size of the squarefree
 part of k introduced in version 1.4.21. (I forgot to note it here). Thanks
 `Cruelty' for reporting this.

Version 1.4.23: (Posted 16 February 2007)
Decoupled the power residue test limit from the subsequence base exponent.
 Now it is possible to test for 5,8,9th power residues while sieving in
 subsequence base b^60, previously it was necessary to use base b^360.

Version 1.4.22:
Extended power residue tests to 9-th power residues. Faster for SoB.dat and
 riesel.dat, but no gain for sr5data.txt.
Replaced the power residue bitmaps with pre-computed tables of lists.

Version 1.4.21: (Posted 14 February 2007)
Set CHECK_FOR_GFN=1 in sr5sieve.h to recognise when a sequence consists of
 Generalised Fermat numbers A^2^y+1 and thus only consider candidate factors
 p=x*2^(y+1)+1 for that sequence.
Set HAVE_MMAP=1 in config.h to use mmap() instead of malloc()/read() to load
 Legendre symbol tables from the cache file. If mmap() fails, warn and fall
 back to using malloc()/read() instead.
Set HAVE_MALLOPT=1 in config.h to reduce the threshold below which malloc()
 allocates blocks using anonymous mmap(). This reduces heap fragmentation
 during init and allows more memory to be released before the sieve starts.

Version 1.4.20: (Posted 9 February 2007)
Calculate the optimal baby/giant steps ratio based on the actual instead of
 expected number of subsequences passing the power residue tests.
If USE_SETUP_LADDER=1, check whether it is faster to use an addition ladder
 to fill the (1/b^d) (mod p) array.
Added -v switch to print some information useful for debugging or tuning.
Added -l -L switches to set L1 and L2 cache size (in Kb).
Added -H -Q switches to allow hashtable size and subsequence base to be
 manually overriden.

Version 1.4.19: (Posted 5 February 2007)
Don't double the hashtable size if it would exceed the maximum size for the
 type of hashtable element (2^15 by default).
Pre-compute the largest power b^(Q/d) < p_min, where d divides Q.
Use the 2nd variant of inline mulmod code for the ppc64. Thanks Ed for
 testing the alternatives.
The sieve limit for ppc64 is 2^63 when using assembler mulmods, not 2^52.
Added x86-64 assembler powmod (powmod-k8.S)

Version 1.4.18: (Posted 10 January 2007)
Improved the SSE2 powmod code a little.
Added Mark Rodenkirch's changes to the ppc64 assembler mulmod() function.

Version 1.4.17: (Posted 8 January 2007)
Added SSE2 assembler powmod function for 32-bit machines. 7% gain for P4.
Updated srtest to check SSE2 vector functions.

Version 1.4.16: (Posted 6 January 2007)
Added SSE2 assembler vec2_mulmod64_*() and lshift128() functions for 32-bit
 machines. Set USE_VECTOR=1 to enable. About 9% gain on my P4/Celeron.
Build 32-bit *-pentium4 binaries with 8Kb/256Kb cache and SSE2 enabled.

Version 1.4.15:
Used the fact that for b in {2,3,5} and p=1 (mod 120), b^((p-1)/120) has
 order mod p strictly less than 120 to simplify manipulation of the power
 residue bitmaps. (Max left shift will not exceed 60 bits for these bases).
Added USE_FPU_MULMOD option (but not enabled) to use FPU instead of SSE2
 instructions in the x86-64 assembler mulmod64(). This will be slower, but
 should allow sieving for factors up to 2^62, as with the i386 versions.
Added L1/L2_CACHE_SHIFT options: i586 build assumes 8Kb/128Kb, i686 build
 assumes 16Kb/256Kb, k8 and ppc64 builds assume 32Kb/512Kb.
 Initial hashtable size is doubled if it will still fit in half of L1 cache.
 The sieve of Eratosthenes bitmap will use half of L2 cache.

Version 1.4.14: (Posted 30 December 2006)
Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.4.12 where the bitmap code used by the
 octic residue test performed a shift equal to the width of the bitmap word.
 This only affected performance, not results.

Version 1.4.13: (Posted 29 December 2006)
Fixed a bug in version 1.4.12 which could cause 1/240 of factors to be
 missed (about half of those factors for which -kbc is a 120th power residue
 would be missed).
Only consider the square-free part of b when constructing Legendre symbol
 lookup tables for k*b^n+c.

Version 1.4.12: (Posted 28 December 2006)
Check whether -ckb^n is an octic residue before including k*b^n+c in the
 sieve. This is of marginal benefit for the base 5 projects, but a 5% gain
 for sr2sieve with SoB.dat. (Set OCTIC_CHECK=0 in sr5sieve.h to disable).

Version 1.4.11:
Fixed a (probably harmless) bug in mod64_init/fini() that may have prevented
 the FPU control word being correctly restored on i386.
Added inline assembler mulmod64()/sqrmod64() functions for x86-64.

Version 1.4.10:
Three options for testing on ppc64, change -DUSE_INLINE_ASSEMBLER=X in the
 Makefile to X=1, X=2 or X=3. X=1 gives same behaviour as version 1.4.8.
Added -Xassembler -mregnames to CPPFLAGS for PPC/Linux.

Version 1.4.9:
Use inline assembler mulmod64() by default on PPC.
Enforce a minimum hashtable size of 2^10. (faster for very small projects
 like S/R base 4).

Version 1.4.8: (Posted 8 December 2006)
`sr5sieve -a K N0 N1' will write an ABC format file `K.txt' for sequence
 K*5^n+/-1 with terms N0 <= n <= N1 taken from sr5data.txt.
Removed .parity field from seq_t, calculate parity as needed instead.

Version 1.4.7: (Posted 7 December 2006)
Fixed a bug that prevented a range in sr5work.txt sepearated by a '-'
 character being parsed correctly. Thanks `Xentar' for reporting this.

Version 1.4.6: (Posted 4 December 2006)
`sr5sieve -c' will create a cache file sr5cache.bin of Legendre symbol
 lookup tables for sequences in sr5data.txt, then exit. If a normal
 invocation of sr5sieve finds a valid cache file in the current directory
 when started, it will load the lookup tables from the file instead of
 building them from scratch. Thanks Micha for the suggestion.
Make CONST_EMPTY_SLOT=0 the default for 64-bit machines.

Version 1.4.5: (Posted 1 December 2006)
Fixed another bitmap related bug introduced in version 1.2.4 that caused
 half of the found factors to be incorrectly reported as duplicates on
 64-bit machines. Thanks Ed for the report.
Added a warning to the linux64-k8 binary that it is untested.

Version 1.4.4: (Posted 30 November 2006)
Save and restore r2 register in expmod-ppc64.S, fixes segfault on PPC/Linux.
 Thanks Ed for the report and Mark for the fix.
A few more tweaks to the i386 assembler mulmod/powmod code: 2% faster on P4,
 no change for P3.
The range `100,101' in sr5work.txt can now be given as `100-101' or `100 101'
 if preferred. Thanks Micha for the suggestion.
Report the expected number of factors for a range when beginning a new range
 and log along with the actual number found when the range is finished.
Fixed trial factoring in core32() which could cause init delays for
 sequences with large prime k. Thanks Citrix for reporting this bug.

Version 1.4.3: (Posted 27 November 2006)
Fixed an overflowing left shift in bitmap.h that wrecked havoc with the
 bitmaps on machines where uint_fast32_t is wider than 32 bits. This bug was
 introduced in version 1.2.4 and probably caused about 75% of factors to be
 missed on affected machines. Thanks Ed for the help tracking this problem
 down.
Test for __ppc64__ or __powerpc64__ to recognise PowerPC 64.

Version 1.4.2: (Posted 26 November 2006)
Fixed a typo in arithmetic.h which was preventing the sqrmod code being used.
Test sqrmod64() in srtest too.
Restored ASFLAGS for ppc64 which were accidentally deleted in version 1.4.1.
Made assembler pre2_* functions into PRE2_* macros. Benefits GCC 4.1.
Better FPU instruction scheduling in i386 assembler mulmod64()/powmod64().
 Speedup for P3 is about 10% compared to version 1.4.0.

Version 1.4.1: (Posted 24 November 2006)
Fixed mpz_get/set_uint64() in srtest to work on 32-bit MSB systems.
Added a 'make check' target which builds and runs srtest.
Renamed assembler *.s files to *.S so that CPP can remove comments.
Added NEED_UNDERSCORE option to config.h for those systems (mingw32, OS X)
 which need an underscore prepended to global assembler symbols.
Run 'make ARCH=ppc64linux' to compile for Linux/PPC64 (same as ARCH=ppc64
 but no underscores on global assembler symbols, registers rN renamed to N.
 This is just for ease of testing as there are still unresolved problems
 with this build).

Version 1.4.0: (Posted 22 November 2006)
New i386 assembler mulmod64() and powmod64() functions give correct results
 for all primes up to 2^62. Testing against GMP revealed that all earlier
 versions could give occasional incorrect results for primes as low as 2^46.
 (To date the Base 5 project distributed sieve has not yet reached 2^42).
Added sqrmod64() function for use by generic powmod64().

Version 1.3.5:
Print Legendre symbol table data when compiled with DEBUG=yes.

Version 1.3.4: (Posted 19 November 2006)
Exchange %ebx,%ebp in powmod64().
Set CONST_EMPTY_SLOT in hashtable.h to use a constant value to mark empty
 hashtable slots. This requires one extra 16-bit register/constant comparison
 in lookup(), but avoids a 64-bit register/memory comparison when the slot is
 in fact empty. A 3% gain for P2/P3 machines, 1% for the P4.

Version 1.3.3: (Posted 31 October 2006)
When range is complete write the number of factors found to sr5sieve.log.

Version 1.3.2: (Posted 28 October 2006)
Save the factor count to the checkpoint file so that status line reports
 total factors found since the start of the current range. Thanks `tnerual'
 for the suggestion.

Version 1.3.1: (Posted 24 October 2006)
Assembler powmod64() for i586.
Check whether -ckb^n is a quintic residue.

Version 1.3.0: (Posted 20 October 2006)
Check whether -ckb^n is a cubic or quartic residue before adding k*b^n+c to
 the BSGS list.
Assembler powmod64() for i686 (just hand tweaking of the GCC output).
Removed redundant SUBSEQ[].mcount field when not debugging.
Allow sieving with p < 2^32 provided p is greater than the greatest k value.
 (pmin is automatically increased to kmax+1 with a warning if necessary).
Ensure that the number of baby steps cannot exceed maximum hash table size.

Version 1.2.7: (Posted 20 October 2006)
Compute (p/2)%m instead of [p%(2*m)]/2 in setup64().
Added -r and -s command line switches to read SoB.dat and riesel.dat when
 compiled with BASE=2.

Version 1.2.6: (Posted 1 October 2006)
Fixed yet another division by zero, this one in progress_report() occurs if
 more than one factor is found per millisecond. Thanks to Micha for
 reporting this bug.
Removed a redundant call to fill_bits() in prime_sieve().
Added memset_fast32() to replace memset() in prime_sieve() and make_bitmap().

Version 1.2.5: (Posted 28 September 2006)
Fixed an array bound bug introduced in version 1.2.4. Only affected GCC 3.4,
 and then only when sr5data.txt contained more than 320 sequences.
Fixed a division by zero in print_status() that occurs in versions 1.2.[34]
 if a factor is found before one calendar second has elapsed. Thanks to
 Carlos for reporting this bug.

Version 1.2.4: (Posted 27 September 2006)
Use uint_fast32_t type for bitmap words. This should give ideal results on
 both 32-bit and 64-bit machines.
Error instead of warning if there is a problem writing to the factors file.
Write all warning and error messages to the log file.
Added code for i386 to avoid computing some 64->32 remainders (which require
 a library call) by computing some extra 32->32 remainders (which can be
 done inline). However the gain is slight, 0.5% at best.

Version 1.2.3: (Posted 25 September 2006)
Precompute Legendre(-ckb^n,p) for each sequence k*b^n+c and store the
 positive results in a bitmap. This increases memory use and initialisation
 time significantly, but also increases throughput by 3-12% depending on
 machine (3% for P4/Celeron, 8% for Katmai P3, 12% for Coppermine P3).
Print some progress messages during the initialisation step.
Use non-scrolling output for progress reports.

Version 1.2.2: (Posted 17 September 2006)
Variable sized local arrays are slower with GCC 3.4, faster with other GCC
 versions. Use fixed size local arrays when compiling with GCC 3.4.

Version 1.2.1: (Posted 13 September 2006)
Reduce HASH_MAX_DENSITY from 0.8 to 0.65.
setup64() routine now efficiently handles sequences with both odd and even n.

Version 1.2.0: (Posted 10 September 2006)
For each sequence k*5^n+c, check whether -ck (or -5ck if n is odd) is a
 quadratic residue with respect to p. If not, don't apply BSGS to this
 sequence for p. This increases throughput by 28% on my P3.

Version 1.1.6:
Use uniformly sized bitmaps for each subsequence so .m_low and .m_high
 fields are no longer needed.
Removed unnecessary sequence .type field.

Version 1.1.5: (Posted 6 September 2006)
New invmod32_64() function taken from Jason Papadopoulos's Msieve 1.10
 results in a 10% speedup on my P3.
Removed unused mod64(), addmod64(), submod64() functions.

Version 1.1.4: (Posted 3 September 2006)
Uncommented changes to assembler verions of memset32_8() which were
 accidentally left commented out in version 1.1.3.
Take advantage of the fact that all our sequences k*b^n+c have c=+/-1 to
 save one mulmod when computing -c/k (mod p).

Version 1.1.3: (Posted 1 September 2006)
Relaxed asm constraints on i386 memset32_8(). Added x86-64 version.
Small improvement to powmod64() saves one mulmod per call.
Removed unused sieve_high variable.
Use invmod32_64(a,p) instead of invmod64(a,p), gives 10% speedup on my P3.

Version 1.1.2: (Posted 27 August 2006)
Removed unused lmod64().
Unrolled clear_hashtable() loop, optimising seperately for 32 or 64 bit
 machines, with inline assembler version for i386 (about 5% faster on P3).

Version 1.1.1: (Posted 12 August 2006)
Adjusted the formula for choosing b^Q to favour slightly lower Q. sieving in
 base 5^60 is a little faster than in base 5^240 with the current (309
 sequences) sr5data.txt.

Version 1.1.0: (Posted 9 August 2006)
Changed the way that Q is chosen for sieving in base b^Q, uses the same
 method as srsieve 0.4.1 allowing more Q values to be considered.

Version 1.0.1:
Added ARCH=k8 entry in Makefile.
Removed unused remaining_terms variable.
Changed pre2_mulmod64_init() to make use of stack created by mod64_init().

Version 1.0.0: (Posted 28 July 2006)
Split from srsieve source archive srsieve-0.3.13.tar.gz.
Made many variables into compile-time constants.
Removed sections of the code that never get used, e.g. 32 bit arithmetic.
