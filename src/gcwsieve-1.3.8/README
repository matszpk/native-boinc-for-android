GCWSIEVE
========

This is a sieve for Generalised Cullen and Woodall numbers n*b^n+/-1, where
b is fixed. The algorithm was taken from a mersenneforum.org post by Harsh
Aggarwal. Modular arithmetic and Sieve of Eratosthenes code was taken from
srsieve, much of which was contributed by Mark Rodenkirch.

Given terms n*b^n+/-1, and factors P0 < p < P1, the following limits apply:
 0 < n < 2^32
 1 < b < 2^32
 b,n < P0 < P1 < 2^52 (2^51 for x86-64, 2^62 for x86, 2^63 for ppc64)
 The maximum number of terms in the sieve is 2^31-1 (2^28-1 for x86).

Note: This is not a stand-alone sieve. It requires an existing input file
in ABC format, and it can only find factors p > b,n for terms n*b^n+/-1.
Therefore you need to begin the sieve and remove all smaller factors with
another program, e.g. MultiSieve. (Or use the gcwsieve-smallp executables).

Also note: gcwsieve is optimised for the situation where the gaps between
successive n in terms n*b^n+/-1 are quite large or irregular, for example
when only prime n are being tested or when many terms have already been
sieved out. For the normal case where all n in a range are being tested
MultiSieve is probably faster, especially on non-SSE2 machines.

    --no-sse2          Don't use SSE2 vector optimisations.

    --no-prefetch      Prevent use of software prefetch.
 -t --threads NUM      Start NUM child threads. (Default 0).

These options are only available for the x86-64 executable:
    --intel            Process 4 terms in parallel. (Default for Intel CPUs).
    --amd              Process 6 terms in parallel. (Default for AMD CPUs).


Arguments to -p, -P, -n, -N can be given in 'e' notation, e.g. `-p 1e9'
instead of `-p 1000000000'.

If the sieve range is not specified by -p and -P then ranges will be read
from the file `work.txt' in the current directory. This file should contain
one pair A,B per line, sieving will be in the range A*10^9 <= p <= B*10^9.
When the current range finishes, the first line will be deleted and the next
range read from the file, until no more lines are left.

Periodic checkpoints will be written to the file `checkpoint.txt', and if
this file contains a valid checkpoint when gcwsieve starts it will use it to
resume sieving from where it was stopped.

If no command line arguments are given but `gcwsieve-command-line.txt'
exists in the current directory, then the command line will be as if the
first line of this file had been used to invoke gcwsieve. The full command
line must be given, not just the switches, e.g. `gcwsieve -v ...' rather
than just `-v ...'. This may be useful on some GUI machines where the
command shell and batch files have been disabled for security reasons.

If the switch `-u STR' is used then the default file names
`work.txt', `factors.txt', `checkpoint.txt', `gcwsieve.log' are changed to
`work-STR.txt', `factors-STR.txt', `checkpoint-STR.txt', `gcwsieve-STR.log'.
This allows multiple gcwsieve processes to be run from the same directory by
starting each process with a unique string STR. The file names specified by
the -w, -c and -f switches override the names assigned by the -u switch.

MultiSieve can create an ABC file containing terms with many different
bases. To continue sieving such a file with gcwsieve, use the -b switch to
sieve one base at a time. For example `gcwsieve -b 5 ...' will discard all
terms except those of the form b*5^n+/-1 as the input file is read.

The default output file written when the -o switch is used can be read by
PFGW and Phrot. To create an output file readable by LLR, add the -m switch.


ABC FILE
========

The input file for terms N1*B^N1+C1, N2*B^N2+C2, ... must be in one of the
following formats:


1. (MultiSieve/LLR compatible)
------------------------------

ABC $a*$b^$a$c // [...] <P0>
<N1> <B> <C1>
<N2> <B> <C2>
[...]

B must be constant for all terms. The // and everything following it are
optional. P0 will be used as the start of the sieve if the -p command line
switch is not supplied. This format will be used for the output file if the
--multisieve switch is given.

For example, a file for the terms 1500113*2^1500113+1, 1500353*2^1500353-1:

ABC $a*$b^$a$c // CW Sieved to: 40002769787
1500113 2 +1
1500353 2 -1


2. (Variable C)
---------------

ABC $a*<B>^$a$b // [...] <P0>
<N1> <C1>
<N2> <C2>
[...]

The // and everything following it are optional. P0 will be used as the
start of the sieve if the -p command line switch is not supplied. This
format will be used for the output file if the --multisieve switch is not
given and some terms have different C values.

For example, a file for the terms 1500113*2^1500113+1, 1500353*2^1500353-1:

ABC $a*2^$a$b // Sieved to: 40002769787
1500113 +1
1500353 -1


3. (Fixed C)
------------

ABC $a*<B>^$a<+/-C> // [...] <P0>
<N1>
<N2>
[...]

The // and everything following it are optional. P0 will be used as the
start of the sieve if the -p command line switch is not supplied. This
format will be used for the output file if the --multisieve switch is not
given and all terms have the same C value.

For example, a file for the terms 1500113*2^1500113+1, 1500353*2^1500353+1:

ABC $a*2^$a+1 // Sieved to: 40002769787
1500113
1500353
