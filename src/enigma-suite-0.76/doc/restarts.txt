Some notes about the restarting procedure used in hillclimb.c:
==============================================================

There seem to be many ways of introducing randomness to kick a hill climb
into successful action. Among these are:

  - Programming errors:  Yes, that's right. Some messages that are
    otherwise very difficult to break yield in one pass when the
    program contains a single error (like falsely not accepting a
    higher score). The cost of deliberately switching errors on/off
    is high.

  - Systematic reswapping of plugs often works well, but seems to
    be outperformed by the method I finally chose.

  - padding a short message with a random letter sometimes works.
    Cost of doing this systematically is high.

  - truncate the beginning of the message by (1,2,3 ...) letters [[1], p203].
    I have not tried this extensively, it may very well be better than the
    method I chose.


This is what I settled on:

I came up with the idea (read: I have not seen it mentioned
before) to use random testing orders as a restarting method.
The basic testing method is the same as in [[1], p198], which
tests plugs alphabetically in a systematic way. The systematic
way is kept, but on instead of testing alphabetically a new
random order is chosen on each restart.

Individually, each random order would not yield a greater success rate
than the alphabetic one (see also [[1], p205]). However, for each message
there is a bunch of testing orders that lead to a successful single pass
decryption. This restarting method attempts to find one of those.


There /may/ be one testing order that does yield a greater success rate:

Testing in the order of frequency of letters in the ciphertext seems
to give a slight edge in the range of 0.5%-1%. This is only a theory
and I have *not* verified it on enough messages to claim it is true.
However, it does not hurt, so I chose to use that order for the first pass,
then switch to random orders.
